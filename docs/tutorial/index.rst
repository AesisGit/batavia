The idea behind Batavia is to take Python bytecode, and ship it to a browser
where it runs in a Javascript implementation of the Python virtual machine.

This means it is possible to write web applications 100% in Python - so those
new to web development don't need to learn multiple languages to develop web
apps.

These tutorials are step-by step guides for using Batavia in your own projects.
